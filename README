Suppose we have n people that need to fill up m office hours. We can construct a bipartite graph that maps each person to the dates they can hold office hours, and assign the edges between these two sets a capacity of 1. Then, we add a sink and source node, and put edges between the source and the people, with a capacity of some number (I haven't thought this through 100%), and a capacity of 1 between each date and the sink.
